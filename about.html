            <h1>Abit about myself</h1>
            <p>
                I'm an inspired young BSC Student and Junior Software Developer who is self-motivated and inquisitive
                about
                the world around him.
                <br><br>
                I found myself doing many things that involve technology and economics - from Web
                design or even System integration of servers, to complete analysis of forex markets and trading.
                <br><br>
                Currently busy working on growing skills in my small Web Hosting projects and getting some ideas ready
                for
                markets - at the same time attending university to increase my knowledge on certain aspects of the
                Industries of information technology and finance, which I look forward to venture into.
                <br><br>
                Development is at the core of what I live for, which is a drive to create and make things that work to
                simplify. I find myself thinking about how things work and how could it be made better with software and
                hardware at times.
                <br><br>
                Solving problems with the code I write, has to be one of the most rewarding and amazing things in the
                world, knowing
                that one line of code could be the difference of me standing in a line for an hour and clicking a button
                to achieve the same result is great. Understanding to code helps me have the power make solutions in
                places that may
                look like died industries.
